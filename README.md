## Overview
As a user of "Gamerstar Plus" I got access to the archive of pdfs.
This is part of the subscription. 
There is the option to download the previous and current editions from 1997 to current day.
But there is one gap, you can't download them in one job. You need to open each edition and then save it.
Even as I got (most) of the editions in paper, I wanted to get them all as pdf.
That is where **gsArchivPDFDownloader** comes in. It will connect with your credentials (yes, you still need a subscription, this is automation not "(G)amestar (t)heft (a)utomation ...)
open all editions from 1997/9 to 2021/3 and download them to a selectable folder.
```
Info: Important change - since 0.5.6 a new gs_credential.json is used to seperate credentials from other settings
```
Here is the link to the GS forum: https://www.gamestar.de/xenforo/threads/schon-mal-alle-hefte-aus-dem-plus-archiv-geladen-wenn-nein-dann.470604/

### Demo Video
Check this small demo Video: 
Video shows Version 0.1 - current solution works similar, with a bit different logging  
[Demo Video](http://www.kastaban.de/demo_mp4/gsArchivePDFDownloader.mp4 "Demo Video")  
The video displays what the start of the program would look like, than the start of the download. In this sample there are already some previous downloaded file. It will skip 1998/1 to 1998/6, than it will download 1998/7. Skip 8/1998 as also previously downloaded. Download 9/1998 and skip again 10/1998. The job was stopped for demo after 1/1999 and finally a tree is displayed. This is what the years should look like in the very end.

### Exclusion
* GS added a spam protection in late 2024. V0.9.3 is aware of the protection and re-tries the login 3 times. 
* The edition 2017/10 was a exception until May 
  11th 2021: Caused by an error in "Blättercatalog"  
To prevent a error the edition is listed in [gs.json](#edit-gsjson) in key "skip_editions"  
(thx to thomas-k for motivation): A warning will be displayed in case you try to download this edition  
  (09 March 2021) - I contacted GS on that.   
  (12 March 2021) - the edition is downloadable as a ZIP,but not from blätterkatalog which uses the program  
  (11 May   2021) - hightower5 reported this as working -> see issue#10
  
* The cover of 2021/08 misses some text
This is caused by a faulty pdf, I'm no expert on PDFs, but it looks like a font is missing in the pdf.
  
## Technologies
The gsArchivPDFDownloader obviously was created in Python with Selenium and Chrome4Testing and Chromedriver.
[Chromedriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads?hl=de)

Up to 0.9.0 Firefox and Geckodriver was used.

For users with less experience, basically what it does:
Python opens a chrome for testing instance (so your system browser does not get used) by the webdriver chromedriver (chromedriver is the link between Selenium and the chrome for testing browser), and than it simulates browser actions like a user does. Selenium is widly used to automate tests of web applications.

As I expect that the webpage may be altered by some time, I guess later the automation will fail. The program is to some extent configurable for this case. 
First use (env)
```
* The job ran successful with webpages at 12. October 2024.
* Python 3.10 
* Selenium was version 4.25.0
* requests 2.32.3
* pypdf2 3.0.1
* pywin32 307
* Chromedriver 129.0.6668.100
* Chrome for testing 129.0.6668.100
* hosting OS was Windows 11 (23H2)
```

## Setup
* Install obviously python (assuming default settings)
```
winget install python.python.3.10
```
If you install it by winget, open a new prompt, otherwise the env vars may not yet exist in the same shell.

The next commands are written in case you use only one python. But Python suports multi versions installations.
Maybe by chnace some other software installed already python?
Check on a command prompt with :
```
where python.exe
```
In case oyu see something like 
```
C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe
C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe
C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe
C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe
```
try to add the 
C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe
to every line or replace python.exe by the full path, like

C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe -m pip....

* Update pip itself
```
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

* install with pip libs
```
pip install selenium==4.25.0 pypdf2==3.0.1 pywin32==307 requests==2.32.3
```
* Get gsArchivPDFDownloader.py and gs.json from this repository  
Use one of the two options  
  - Go to "releases" and download the last release published as ZIP
  - Download from main   
```
Click on "Code" (green button on top), than select "Download ZIP"
Extract the Content to some writeable folder. Eg. \gsDownloader\gsArchivePDFDownloader 
```
The difference is that main, may contain newer und not so tested code.

* Browser and Chromedriver?
  On the first run (not help or version), the script will download the browser and the driver from google

### Filenamepattern in gs.json
| Name          | value allowed        | Remark                                                                                                       | Introduced |
|:---|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------:|
| filenamepattern_intarget      | string | The downloaded file will be moved with that name to the downloadtarget folder                                |    v0.1    |
| filenamepattern_fromserver      | string   | That is the file we get after we click on the "alle" button in "blätterkatalog"                              |    v0.1    |  
| filenamepattern_fromserverwhiledl      | string   | That is the file we get while thwe file is downloaded |   v0.8   |  

Basic idea: The filename pattern is read from file and than the strings "\<ausgabe\>" and "\<jahr\>" are replaced by the current proceeded values.

So you do not like the naming of the files? You want to honor GS? You need a file name like: "Tolle GameStar Nr. aus dem Jahr 1997 mit Ausgabe 9.pdf"
than alter the "filenamepattern_intarget" to ```"filenamepattern_intarget": "Tolle GameStar Nr. aus dem Jahr <jahr> mit Ausgabe <ausgabe>.pdf"```
or simpler you want a filename like "GameStar 1997-9.pdf" than use "filenamepattern_intarget" to ```"filenamepattern_intarget": "GameStar <jahr>-<ausgabe>.pdf"```

I found out during the creation of v0.2 that the server changed the naming. They moved from "GameStar_Nr._9_1997.pdf"  to  "GameStar Nr. 9_1997". Mind the small change in use of the "\_"
To overcome this small but maybe annoying thing (maybe "they" did not like my downloader, or it was Shodan, GLaDOS...), I added also here a way to get the right URL.
As mentioned in the start and end, if "they" change fundamental things, upsi....it will not work anymore.
With that we could try a small fix.

In April 2022 a new file download name is introduced (or seen). While downloading a differnet name is seen. Not sure 
why or what caused this, but at least the  <filenamepattern_fromserverwhiledl> is a option to get arround this.

### skip_editions in gs.json
| Name          | value allowed        | Remark|
|:---|:---:|:---|
| skip_editions      | string   | a list of each year with editions that cause error while downloading (server issue), request to download with a comma separated value; no spaces,no leading 0|

Currently, (May 2021) there should be only one edition (2017/10)

## Run 
### commandline argument
Attention : v0.9.0 and later changed the commandline 
```
usage: gsArchivPDFDownloader.py [-h] [-e] [-c] [-l] [-f] [-y YEAR] [-r RANGE] [-o] [-mc] [-v]

Download GameStar PDFs from webpage

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e, --edition         Run Type Edition (Magazin)
  -c, --cover           Run type Cover (Coverpack)
  -l, --latest          try to download always the newest (starting from last downloaded 2024-10) to most recent
  -f, --full            a full download of all editions/covers from 1997/09 to 10/2024
  -y YEAR, --year YEAR  a single year in range [1997-2035]
  -r RANGE, --range RANGE
                        a range in format yyyy:mm-yyyy:mm; example -r 2019:09-2020:11
  -o, --overwrite       force download even file exists
  -mc, --missingcheck   List all missing files.
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

```

For all commands (execpt help and version) you need to use either [--edition|--cover]

#### --edition
This runtype creates a browser and logs in to PLUS with credentials.

#### --cover
This runtype creates a browser and downloads covers. No login is used.

#### --full 

To start a download job of editions open a cmd and type
```
python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py -e -f 
```
```
python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py --edition --full 
```

Now the job will start, it will check and create the "downloadtarget" folder.
It will open a chrome3testing browser, login and open the URL for the archive.
Than it will save the file. After the download is complete (no *.crdownload is seen anymore), the new file is moved 
to a sub folder of the year.
In other words the structure of the sample will look like
```

C:
  |
  +--download
            |
            +--Gamestar-archive
                              |
                              +1997  <-- all editions of that year (4)
                              +1998  <-- all editions of that year (12)
                              +1999  <-- all editions of that year (12)
                              +2000  <-- all editions of that year (12)
                              +...         
```

#### --cover
To start a download job open a cmd and type
```
python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py -c -f
```
```
python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py --cover --full 
```

Now the job will start, it will check and create the "downloadtarget" folder.
It will open a firefox/geckodriver browser and then tries in a loop to download all covers starting from 2000/01 to 
the current year. Than it will save the file. After the download is complete (no *.part is seen anymore), the new file is moved to a sub folder of the year.
In other words the structure of the sample will look like
```

C:
  |
  +--download
            |
            +--Gamestar-archive
                              |
                              +--covers
                                      |
                                      +2000  <-- all covers of that year
                                      +2001  <-- all covers of that year 
                                      +2002  <-- all covers of that year 
                                      +2000  <-- all covers of that year 
                                      +...         
```
It will not check for errors. In case a cover  is missing, it simply tries the next. Practically the first cover 
found is 2015/12. Maybe the older covers are not there or in a different format. I kept the start year 2000 just for 
no good reason.

#### --range
```
python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py --edition --range YYYY:mm-YYYY:mm

Example: python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py --edition --range 2012:02-2013:10
```
the argument ```YYYY:mm-YYYY:mm``` is in format   
```4 digits start year>:<2 digits start month>-<4 digits end year>:<2 digits end month>```

The start year/month needs to be older than the end year/month.   
Script will check for correct format and valid range.
Anything from 1997/08 to 2039/12 will be accepted as valid.

#### --year
eg. a commandline  ``` python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py -e -y 2020 ``` or  ``` python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py 
--edition --year 2020``` 
will download all editions from 2020.
In case the commandline is used, each year will try to get a 13 editions. Which currently does only exists in 2017.  
Yes I know that does not make much sense, and this issue will be adressed in a next version.  

This run type uses the "abortlimit" of the gs.json file to trigger an abort if the number is reached.  
in case the number is 2 and the flow is like this: success - fail - fail > Abort  
in case the number is 2 and the flow is like this: success - fail - success > the run will continue  


#### --latest
In case you want to repeat the download on a monthly basis after you downloaded all (with the initial function), this is the option for you.
```
python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py --edition --latest
```
This run will read 'latestdownload' from the json file and tries now to download the next edition, eg. the last download was 2021/03 and we are currently at the 28th of April,  
this will first try to download the edition of 04/2021, than it will also check as it is past the 15th of the current month also to download the edition 05/2021.
I guess that maybe around the third week of a month there is a potential release of the next edition.
The "latest" commandline also takes in credit of a year jump (\*crossing fingers\*) around December.
Of course it makes maybe somehow sense to combine this with the json option "browser_display_on_latest" = "no".
In this run type, the max edition number of a year is 12. So if ever a 13th edition will come up, I need a fix.
```
Hint: If you create the task, create it as:  
Windows 11 , hidden, run without user logged in , do not store password  
add the absolute path to the python.exe in program field, add the "--latest" as argument and  
set the "start in folder" to the folder the gsArchivPDFDownloader.py is in.
```

In case you want to repeat the download of a cover on a monthly basis after you downloaded all (with the initial 
function --cover --full), this is the option for you.
```
python gsArchivPDFDownloader.py --coverlatest
```
This run will read 'latestdownload_cover' from the json file and tries now to download the next cover, eg. the last 
download was 2021/03 and we are currently at the 28th of April,  
this will first try to download the cover of 04/2021, than it will also check as it is past the 15th of the 
current month also to download the cover 05/2021.
I guess that maybe around the third week of a month there is a potential release of the next edition.
The "--cover --latest" commandline also takes in credit of a year jump (\*crossing fingers\*) around December.

In this run type, the max cover number of a year is 12. So if ever a 13th cover will come up, I need a fix.

Running this cover latest type is also printing the page defined in the gs.json the the default printer, if the 
option is set.

## Remarks
Since v0.1/v.0.8.0 some parts are changed. Mostly to new error or requested enhancements.
Not sure how many this script used, but as long as I will use it I will update the program with error fixes and enhancements.

## FAQ
* Will it always work?  
  No, it depends on the webpage. In case the fields are renamed it will not work anymore. Taking in account that the basic function will stay the same, editing the names should not be a big issue.
  See change caused  by April 2022.

* It not even download a single bit.  
  Did you edit the gs.json? Or It is broken already, sorry....drop me a note and I will a) fix or b)remove this :-)
  Send me the logfile via GitHub (of course the credentials are blurred in the file)

* It will only download a fraction of the edition like a sample.  
  You may not enter in gs.json the right credentials

* Hell, why you use simple sleeps?  
  ...one time effort...lazy?...eh...I guess you are right, but it worked for me.....sorry. And I tried some limited conditional waits...

* After some successful downloads the job stopped, what is this?  
  I assume this is caused by a timeout, which is not caught. Just restart the job, it will start from the beginning, 
  but skips all already downloaded pdf.  the log may report these editions and you should try a rerun with the same 
  command. This may overcome the issue by it self.
  And since 2024 GS added a spam protection on the login - so do not over extend the script.

* You mixed German and English in the logging?  
  Yes, as I said it was more a one timer. In case I got some time I may convert all to one language.

* One timer? In version 0.x ? You cheating liar....  
  I need to confess, I added some nice features after my initial use...for others...so it's ok?
  
* Printing does not work for me.
  Since 0.9 it is pretty straight forward. Before it was a mess. On the other hand rage against the printer? Give it 
  a second try with versions later 0.9
